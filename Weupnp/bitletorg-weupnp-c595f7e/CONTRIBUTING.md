# Thank you for consdering constributing to weupnp.

Before you submit your pull request, please considering the following:

1. be consistent with the style of the existing code (brackets, newlines, whitespace) 
2. weupnp was designed to be minimal, so do not introduce dependencies to new libraries unless there is some strong reason to do so,
3. provide us with context in the pull request description: each device behaves slightly different and we do not have access to all of them, so it would help us to know what exactly was the problem you were trying to solve.

Other than that, we would be happy to get your help!

Thank you
